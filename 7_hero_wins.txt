After nearly 24 hours of climbing the mountain, the evil elf suddently appears!
- Give me that christmas gift, shouted the evil elf.
But Hugo would never let down whoever the gift was for. He lured the elf to get closer to him,
and when the elf jumped to attack him he just moved to the side and the evil elf fell tumbling down
the mountain.
- Phew! That was close, Hugo whispered quietly, and then he continued his epic quest!
